Software testing career is very peculiar - you can't just go to university and graduate, as none of them offer this field of study. Maybe because of that I hear a lot of questions like: 'how to become a software tester?'. Today I'd like to answer them and compile good advice (at least in my opinion) in one place.

Throughout the post, I'll use a lot of quotes from '[How Google Tests Software](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027)' book. I also recommend posts from [blacksintechnology](https://www.blacksintechnology.net/career-advice-for-entry-level-software-testers/), [guru99](http://www.guru99.com/software-testing-career-complete-guide.html), [reddif](http://m.rediff.com/getahead/report/career-why-are-soft-skills-so-important/20150529.htm), [deccanherald](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/249714/importance-english-employment.html) and last but not least, [my blog](http://awesome-testing.com/2016/02/dos-and-donts-for-testers-2016-edition.html)(but have in mind that it was written for testers with some experience already).

As usual, a word of caution (which you should adopt for everything btw): those are just my views, they don't have to true for you and your environment. The order is pseudorandom.

**Education**

> Google takes hiring engineers seriously. In general, our engineers have computer science or related degrees from accredited universities.

A highly controversial topic makes a lot of people agitated and emotional. From my experience though testers with computer science background are indeed better (and I'm not the only with such opinion).

Now imagine you don't have any IT education and you are being recruited by someone like me. Every job interview would be an uphill battle for you. You would have to prove more skills than your peers just because they are not confirmed by 'accredited university' yet.

> Today we interview for general computer science and technical skills combined with a strong requirement for testing aptitude.

Place yourself in pole position and graduate. As Sun Tzu said [fighting an uphill battle](http://suntzusaid.com/book/7/33) is never a good idea.

**Learn English**

> The reality is that the companies consider the candidate's ability or inability to speak fluently in English as one of the major selection criterion.

Obvious one. It's true especially for testers which often have to not only play with the system under test but also actively cooperate with product owners, programmers, managers, etc.

Remember that learning English doesn't have to be boring. Make it fun by reading books, watching sport, and TV shows in English (preferably with English subtitles). Some cities have something like ['Language Exchange Club'](https://www.facebook.com/groups/lec.krakow/)where you can meet people and train foreign language.

**Avoid naysayers and doubters**

> One of the dangers newcomers face in any industry are "broken" and "settled" employees.

Interesting topic. Generally speaking, if we are committing ourselves to something ambitious (like becoming software engineers) there will be people who will show skepticism, doubt, and worries. You need to ignore them and find mentors instead (see point 9). Robert Greene in [48 Laws of Power](https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197) goes as far as to phrase [Law 10 - Infection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfbP4zxpR0o): Avoid the unhappy and unlucky. [Surround yourself with positive people](https://www.happier.com/blog/how-to-be-happier-5-reasons-to-surround-yourself-with-happy-people).
