## The State of IT Salaries and Job Market Trends

We discussed how IT salaries are likely to stabilize in 2025, with significant raises becoming less frequent due to macroeconomic challenges. Inflation-driven adjustments might be rare, and many of us agreed that meaningful salary growth may often require changing companies rather than relying on internal promotions. Despite this, there are still areas of growth—roles in AI, cloud engineering, and DevOps remain in high demand, as these fields continue to address persistent skill shortages.

AI-related positions stood out as a major topic. We acknowledged that while the AI boom is creating numerous opportunities, it’s essential to approach this trend with caution. The market will reward those who can not only work with AI but also integrate it effectively into broader systems. The consensus was that technical expertise paired with specialized knowledge in emerging areas will be key to thriving in this evolving landscape.

The importance of technical skills and self-reliance in testing roles also came up repeatedly. We noted that employers increasingly seek testers who can independently build and maintain testing infrastructure, contributing directly to development pipelines. In this shifting environment, adaptability and technical proficiency are critical for staying competitive.

## The Impact of AI on Testing

We explored how AI is reshaping the field of software testing and debated its potential to replace manual testers entirely. While AI tools like Copilot and other automation solutions are advancing rapidly, we agreed that AI is more likely to augment testing rather than eliminate manual roles altogether. AI excels at handling repetitive tasks, generating test scenarios, and analyzing large datasets, but it still struggles with the nuanced, critical thinking that testers bring to the table.

The conversation highlighted the growing need for testers to adapt to this changing landscape. Roles are shifting from performing manual checks to orchestrating and overseeing AI-driven processes. We noted that while some traditional testing tasks may become obsolete, new opportunities are emerging for testers to validate AI systems, create effective prompts, and ensure the quality of AI-generated outputs. These roles require both technical expertise and a deep understanding of testing principles.

Overall, we agreed that AI’s role in testing will continue to expand, but its adoption will also introduce new challenges. From ethical considerations to ensuring the reliability of AI-driven systems, testers will play a vital role in bridging the gap between human insight and machine efficiency. Rather than fearing replacement, we saw this as an opportunity to redefine and elevate the role of testers in the software development lifecycle.

## Manual Testing vs. Automation

We had a lively discussion about the evolving relationship between manual testing and automation. While manual testing remains valuable in certain contexts, there was broad agreement that automation is becoming the backbone of modern testing strategies. Automation enables scalability, consistency, and efficiency, making it essential for organizations looking to handle complex systems and rapid release cycles. However, we acknowledged that manual testing still plays a critical role in exploratory testing, usability assessments, and situations where human judgment is indispensable.

One key point we raised was the cost-benefit analysis of maintaining manual testers versus investing in automation. While automation requires upfront investment in tools and frameworks, it pays off in the long term by reducing repetitive workloads and catching regressions earlier. On the other hand, manual testers can be deployed more quickly in new projects where automation frameworks have not yet been established, providing immediate feedback.

We also explored the misconception that automation will entirely replace manual testing. Instead, we saw these approaches as complementary. Automation handles repetitive and predictable tasks, freeing testers to focus on higher-level activities such as designing test strategies, identifying edge cases, and analyzing system behavior. Ultimately, the key takeaway was that a balanced approach, leveraging both automation and manual testing, is crucial for delivering high-quality software.

## The Evolution of Testing Frameworks

We delved into the evolution of testing frameworks, particularly the shifting preferences among developers and testers. Frameworks like Playwright, Selenium, and Cypress dominated the discussion. While Selenium has long been a staple in the testing world, we noted that tools like Playwright are gaining popularity due to their modern design, enhanced features, and better integration with today’s tech stacks.

Playwright emerged as a key contender in this space, offering cross-browser support, parallel testing capabilities, and ease of use, which make it a favorite for many teams. We observed that its rising adoption could signal a shift in the industry, especially for teams focused on scalability and performance. However, we acknowledged that Selenium’s extensive ecosystem, community support, and compatibility with legacy systems still make it a strong option for many organizations.

We concluded that staying adaptable and continually evaluating new tools is essential. Frameworks will continue to evolve, and testers need to remain open to learning and adopting technologies that best suit their projects. This willingness to experiment and embrace innovation is what keeps the testing field dynamic and forward-looking. Overall, we agreed that the choice of a framework should be driven by project needs, team expertise, and future scalability rather than trends alone.

## Skill Development and Certification

We discussed the importance of skill development and certifications in shaping a tester’s career. While certifications like ISTQB provide a foundational understanding of testing concepts, their relevance and value depend heavily on the context. For beginners, these certifications can act as stepping stones, offering structured learning and a way to demonstrate knowledge. However, we agreed that real-world experience and hands-on skills often outweigh formal credentials in the eyes of employers.

A recurring theme was the growing demand for interdisciplinary skills. Knowledge of programming, cloud platforms, and DevOps practices is becoming increasingly important for testers to stay competitive. Certifications in these areas, such as AWS or Kubernetes, were highlighted as particularly valuable for expanding a tester’s toolkit and demonstrating technical competence. We emphasized the need for testers to continuously upskill, especially in areas like automation, AI integration, and system architecture.

Mentorship and practical experience were also spotlighted as crucial elements of skill development. We noted that learning from seasoned professionals and working on real-world projects often provides deeper insights than any certification. Additionally, testers should seek opportunities to engage with emerging technologies and frameworks, as this not only enhances their capabilities but also opens doors to specialized roles.

Ultimately, we agreed that while certifications have their place, they are just one piece of the puzzle. The true key to long-term growth lies in a combination of formal learning, practical application, and the adaptability to embrace new challenges and technologies. This balanced approach equips testers to meet the demands of an ever-evolving industry.

We emphasized the critical role of soft skills and leadership in the ever-evolving world of software testing. While technical expertise is essential, the ability to navigate interpersonal dynamics, drive collaboration, and adapt to change often sets exceptional testers apart from the rest. In our discussion, we highlighted how these skills not only enhance individual performance but also contribute to building high-performing teams.

Leadership in testing isn’t confined to formal managerial roles. We agreed that testers can demonstrate leadership by taking ownership of processes, driving quality initiatives, and fostering a culture of improvement within their teams. Effective communication is central to this, enabling testers to advocate for quality, bridge gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and navigate the challenges of global, cross-functional teams.

Adaptability was another key theme, particularly in the context of organizational change. Many of us shared experiences of navigating shifts such as pivots in business strategies, team reorganizations, and even layoffs. The ability to remain composed, motivate others, and realign efforts in such situations is invaluable. We noted that resilience and emotional intelligence are vital for testers to thrive in fast-paced and uncertain environments.

Cultural awareness and collaboration across diverse teams were also discussed. In global organizations, understanding and respecting cultural differences can prevent miscommunication and foster stronger relationships. Testers who can effectively manage these dynamics are better equipped to contribute to international projects and lead globally distributed teams.

Ultimately, we agreed that soft skills complement technical expertise, enabling testers to influence, innovate, and lead effectively. As testing continues to evolve, these skills will remain critical for driving success and maintaining relevance in an increasingly competitive field.

## Remote Work and Agile Practices

We discussed how remote work and Agile practices have transformed the way software testing teams operate, and we debated their future in the IT industry. Remote work, once a necessity during the pandemic, has become a preferred mode of operation for many professionals. While it offers flexibility and reduces commute times, we acknowledged that it also presents challenges, particularly in fostering collaboration and maintaining team cohesion.

Hybrid models emerged as a contentious topic. While they aim to combine the benefits of remote and in-office work, we questioned their effectiveness. Many of us pointed out that hybrid setups often fail to fully satisfy either remote-first employees or those who prefer the office, leading to compromises that can hinder productivity. Still, hybrid models are likely to remain popular as companies experiment with balancing flexibility and collaboration.

Agile practices were another focal point. We examined how methodologies like Scrum and Kanban have evolved in distributed team settings. Many of us advocated for Kanban’s simplicity and adaptability, especially for managing asynchronous workflows in remote environments. However, we noted that Scrum remains widely used, particularly in teams that require structured communication and frequent check-ins.

One recurring theme was the importance of tailoring Agile practices to team needs rather than rigidly adhering to frameworks. Successful Agile implementation often depends on aligning processes with team dynamics and project requirements. We agreed that the focus should always be on delivering value, not just following rituals or processes for their own sake.

In conclusion, while remote work and Agile practices each have their challenges, they also present opportunities for innovation and efficiency. Teams that embrace flexibility, adapt their processes, and prioritize communication are best positioned to thrive in this new era of work.
