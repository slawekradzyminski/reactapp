In [33 Strategies of War ](https://www.amazon.com/Strategies-War-Joost-Elffers-Books/dp/0143112783)Robert Greene starts with the most important part - self-directed warfare. In order to achieve anything in life we have to conquer own fears first. On Monday (23th of April) I had a privilege to speak about [Engineering Productivity](https://www.awesome-testing.com/2017/07/testops-5-engineering-productivity.html) during KraQA meetup. To be honest it wasn't easy. It's fair to say that I have conquered myself there.

### Road

The story begins few years ago when I have started blogging. Things written here can be used as framework & background for future talks. It opened my eyes for public speaking opportunities. I though I was ready for theoretical point of view, I saw my testing thoughts valuable for listeners, but I was afraid of big crowd looking at me.

Then out of nowhere I noticed that [KraQA](https://www.meetup.com/KraQA-pl/)(testing meetup located in Krak√≥w) is looking for help. At first, it wasn't meant to be a speaking opportunity platform, but I just wanted to help the initiative I like. Thanks to very friendly and relaxed atmosphere on meetups I was able to get familiar with more experienced speakers. I even managed to meet with huge part of my future audience, so I wasn't speaking to strangers on Monday.

Third and probably the most important step to my public speaking was [Vistula University](http://www.vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/kontynuacja-edukacji/studia-podyplomowe/informatyka/testowanie-oprogramowania/). I managed to get hired there as a Java basics course lecturer. Groups there can be as high as 30 people, so I quickly gathered confidence in my speaking and teaching skills. At first, I was doing average job, but acting on good feedback I started gradual improvement.

### Feedback from my talk

Rating myself is probably a bad idea, so I'll just copy-paste results.

Probably even with worse ratings I'd be very happy, because as I said already in first paragraph it was more about conquering personal fears.

### Slides

Original slides were in polish. I translated them into English for blog readers.
