[Michael Bolton](https://twitter.com/michaelbolton/), one of the most recognized testers worldwide (assuming we take into account the number of followers), has recently published 20 very interesting tweets on his account. This leads to a very interesting [discussion](https://twitter.com/michaelbolton/status/730748174734901248), which I recommend reading too. Unfortunately, Twitter wasn't designed for such lengthy conversations and it's hard to grasp what's going on there. Don't get me wrong though, I like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/s_radzyminski) and you should too. It seems like most of the IT professionals use it every day and share quality stuff there.

The thing is, as much as I consider those statements valuable and interesting (hence they're all cited here), I can't fully agree with all of them. Twitter char limitation (140) isn't enough to express my doubts, so let's move the discussion to the blog world.

**Edit:** It seems like I may have taken Michael's words out of context, which I hadn't been aware of. Turns out, his views on testing are pretty much like mine. See the comments for clarification.

> 1\. Testing's value will never be /immediately/ clear to everyone, nor will everyone want testers as such. I believe we must accept that.

Such a negative and disempowering statement. I had already talked about the ever-changing [tester's role](http://awesome-testing.blogspot.com/2016/02/dos-and-donts-for-testers-2016-edition.html) these days. Yesterday I had a pleasure to listen to [Micheal Feathers'](https://twitter.com/mfeathers) talk on Geecon titled 'Testing patience'. I managed to capture the key slide from the talk (see below). Why would we strip ourselves from the power to redefine testers' role in IT? It's pretty much in our hands.

> 2\. When we are describing testing's value, we had better be clear on the extents and limits of what testing (and testers) can accomplish.

Fully agree. Testers aren't magicians and saviors. They won't change the flawed design by night. They can however point out the problems early.
