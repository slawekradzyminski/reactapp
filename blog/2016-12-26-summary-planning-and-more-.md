I'm happy to announce that I got myself Christmas gift and this blog is available on:

### [www.awesome-testing.com](http://www.awesome-testing.com/)

I strongly encourage you to follow me on [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/#subscription%2Ffeed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fawesome-testing.blogspot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fposts%2Fdefault) or[Email](https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=blogspot/jBlBXc). This is very convenient, because you don't have to open this site. Full post is delivered in perfectly formatted way.

As I already described in [Five benefits of blogging](http://www.awesome-testing.com/2016/09/anniversary-post-five-benefits-of.html) post things looks good here and I'll continue working in 2017 with exact the same frequency.

Psychologists often say that in order to succeed in some ambitious venture you need to [put it on paper and tell friends](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/in-depth/quit-smoking/art-20045452). Here it is: I plan to get myself into security and penetration testing in 2017. Hoping for a couple of posts about it here.
