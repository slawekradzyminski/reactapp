                When I'm not immersed in code and pipelines, you'll find me enjoying time with my wonderful family, hitting the squash court, exploring new travel destinations, or challenging myself at scrabble. I keep fit with regular gym sessions and wind down by watching TV series with my wife, making sure I strike a balance between professional growth and personal fulfillment.
