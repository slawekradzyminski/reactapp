One of the key challenges that seniors who want to continue developing face is the need to shift their mindset from
being a passive consumer to becoming an active creator. Until now, we have been accustomed to others providing us with
ready-made content, knowledge, and tools. This situation cannot go on indefinitely. Every tool or language has its
application, but at a certain point, no training or tutorial can offer us anything new.

The Model T encourages continuous learning of new things, but that's not enough. It is more effective to think of
oneself as a creator who brings value to others. Therefore, it is worthwhile to participate in a Call for Papers,
conduct internal training, or start co-creating open source projects. Most of our new tasks should be creative.

What I present here may seem obvious, but changing one's mindset and approach is not at all simple. Remaining an expert
in one's field is one thing, but being able to share that knowledge with others and seek innovation is quite another
matter.
