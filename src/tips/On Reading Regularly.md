One of the major challenges faced by seniors aspiring to climb higher is working on complex projects where the goals are known, but the exact path to achieve them is not.

A task that initially seems overwhelming needs to be broken down into phases and smaller tasks, and attempts should be made to estimate them for prioritization purposes both at the organizational level and for individual domain teams.

The above clearly shows that, in addition to pure engineering skills (programming, testing, DevOps), one needs to add product skills, data analysis, and a range of soft skills (persuasion, courage, writing, reporting, empathy, sales, presentation...).

Besides practice, these skills can be honed by regularly reading books from various fields such as:
- Systems thinking
- Critical thinking
- Persuasion
- Human nature
- Motivation
- Charisma
- Management
- Product building

It's worth developing a bookworm habit and reading every day.
