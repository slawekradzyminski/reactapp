Books I recommend for seniors wanting to reach higher:

- [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://amzn.to/49HqvB3)
- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://amzn.to/3Q8C0e3)
- [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://amzn.to/4b2Ei6y)

From all these books emerges the image of a broadly understood engineer, rather than someone focusing on single specialty. One must consistently expand the scope of their work to include programming, DevOps, SRE, etc. Iâ€™m omitting soft skills like public speaking because thatâ€™s a necessity regardless of specialization ðŸ™‚
