Books I recommend for seniors wanting to reach higher:

- [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://amzn.to/3BRcjKK)
- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://amzn.to/4ha0fnX)
- [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://amzn.to/4eK9cmi)

From all these books emerges the image of a broadly understood engineer, rather than someone focusing on single specialty. One must consistently expand the scope of their work to include programming, DevOps, SRE, etc. I’m omitting soft skills like public speaking because that’s a necessity regardless of specialization 🙂
