One of the simplest tips that can be given to seniors is to prioritize their work in such a way that it aligns with the business goals of the company. Working for any organization, we should listen to what is important to leaders and act in accordance with guidelines. Focusing on the most important functionalities ensures visibility and gives a sense of doing something that is important and valued.

Another relatively simple tip to implement is the cyclical, simple, and aesthetic presentation of work progress. Brevity in statements and graphic design (e.g., in Miro) are welcome here so that the threshold for the reader is very low. It's also worth briefly presenting plans for the near future + a vision for the end. Communication should be addressed to leaders so that they are aware and feel that the work is going in the right direction.

It is also worth boasting about successes, both personal and of the team. For leaders, it is important to encourage team members to do this themselves and to pay attention to broadly understood visibility, PR, and expert image building.

In summary: let's pay attention to our visibility. Let's engage in matters important to the company. Let's report progress and successes. Train for effective and concise communication (e.g., on LinkedIn).
