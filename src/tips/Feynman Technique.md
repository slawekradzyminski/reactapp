Getting acquainted with and understanding the work of Professor Richard Feynman has greatly enriched my life. To fully
grasp his ideas, I recommend starting with two excellent books:
- [Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!](https://amzn.to/4b6SYBF)
- [What Do You Care What Other People Think?](https://amzn.to/445WA4z)

One of the main recommendations from the professor is the encouragement to teach others. Most people who do not speak
publicly, write blogs, run YouTube channels, or teach others tend to overestimate their knowledge. Explaining something
in simple language to teach others forces us to build a deep understanding of the subject, thereby accumulating a lot of
knowledge that begins to connect the dots. Having this knowledge connected into a coherent whole makes it much easier
for us to understand new concepts.

To build these visualized connections mentioned on the attached [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1763927221230776741), reading books from related fields is excellent.
Today, I recommend:
- [Continuous Delivery](https://amzn.to/4aH08g8)
- [Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://amzn.to/3UBWwqd)
- [PL - Bezpiecze≈Ñstwo Aplikacji Webowych](https://sklep.securitum.pl/ksiazka-bezpieczenstwo-aplikacji-webowych)

Teaching others has a very bad PR due to the dubious practices of many companies, but please remember that most active
trainers started by writing publicly accessible blogs.
