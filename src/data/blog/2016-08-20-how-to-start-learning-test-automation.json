On another post - <a href=\"https://awesome-testing.com/2016/03/learning-pathways-for-testers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Learning pathways for testers</a>, which was addressed for more experienced engineers, I described how to thrive as a tester not only now, but also in the long run. Today I&#39;d like to describe a topic which places somewhere between those two. I know that there is a lot of people who do only laborious manual testing and would like to automate it but don&#39;t know-how.</p><p>The following post is based on my personal experience (as I successfully completed such a journey for myself) and numerous online discussions.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>Before you start the est automation journey make sure you have at least a basic understanding of the following topics:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Agile and general software development life cycle knowledge</p><p>Testing should be actively presented throughout each software development life cycle phase. You need to make sure that your application would be testable. Some decisions made at the beginning of the project can greatly simplify automated testing. For example sites with nicely implemented &#39;id&#39; names are much easier to test via Selenium.</p><p>Thankfully there are two great books on this topic written by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Testing-Practical-Guide-Testers/dp/0321534468/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Agile Testing</a><br>and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/More-Agile-Testing-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321967054/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">More Agile Testing</a>.</p><p><strong>2</strong>. Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment basic knowledge</p><p>You need to understand where testing stands when it comes to CI &amp; CD. Think for a moment where would you like to place testing in your application pipeline.</p><p>Jez Humble and David Ferley wrote a nice book about this topic, which you really should read,<br>called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Continuous Delivery</a>.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Test automation return of investment consideration</p><p>This is a very complicated topic (<br>see <a href=\"http://www.sqetraining.com/sites/default/files/articles/XDD8502filelistfilename1_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SQE training</a><br>and <a href=\"https://www.ispe.org/pe-ja/roi-of-test-automation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ISPE</a>papers for details) and your expectations should be real. Do not think that automated tests would solve all the problems and magically improve application quality.<br>Automation done wrong can give you a lot of headaches. Don&#39;t forget that the test automation code almost always requires maintenance.</p><h3>Motivation - Personal benefits of being a highly technical tester</h3>\n<p>If you&#39;re still not sure whether automation path is correct, here is a list of obvious benefits that can motivate you:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> More fun</p><p>If you have ever done manual regression testing you know the pain.</p><p>Technical tester analyses problems, investigate possible solutions, implement them, on an almost daily basis. The job becomes more and more intellectually demanding. You start taking coffee breaks not only because you&#39;re bored, but because your mind really needs them.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> More possibilities</p><p>By expanding your knowledge on the automation field you become more and more desirable not only by peers but also for recruiters. Your employability is skyrocketing. This gives you a certain level of security - you know that even in the unlikely event you got fired, you will quickly find a new job.</p><p><strong>3</strong>. More respect</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Google Tests Software</a>authors describe that at one point they realized a simple truth - in order for them to be fully respectable team members, they need to start coding. They finished the journey and are now Currently they are fully integrated team members (as you can read in nice <a href=\"http://blog.fogcreek.com/embedded-testers-in-development-teams-interview-with-trish-khoo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Trish Khoo interview</a>).<br>Aim for the same.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> More money</p><p>With more skills come more money. Simple as that :)</p><h3>Learning at work</h3>\n<p>You should have as many learning opportunities at work as possible. This requires both companies that understands test automation benefits and skilled people around you.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Company consideration</p><blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>There are three types of management commitment needed for successful test automation: money, time and</p><p></p><p>resources.<a href=\"http://www.softwaretestpro.com/itemassets/4772/automatedtestinghandbook.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Automated Testing Handbook</a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Test automation is a software engineering project. It needs to planned, managed, developed, and maintained by skilled people. As a lone manual tester without necessary programming skills, you won&#39;t be able to transition. This is harsh true whether you like it or not. You can play with Selenium on free time, but don&#39;t expect anything fancy. Get managerial buy-in, change project, or seek junior tester position somewhere else.</p><p>After acquiring basic skills you will be able to choose correct frameworks, languages, setup CI, etc., but you really shouldn&#39;t do that as ex manual tester. Don&#39;t fight uphill battle... yet.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> People consideration</p><p>If you&#39;re my avid reader you know how my emphasis I put on mentorship. This is especially true when it comes to skill transition. You really should begin your journey with someone who can help you get started. Focus on writing automated tests and expanding your programming knowledge only. Skilled mentor or just senior tester can give you fast feedback,<br>propose solutions, review code, and show areas of improvement. He can also handle a few harder tasks for you so that you won&#39;t get stuck at one thing forever.</p><p>Always try to surround yourself with smarter people.</p><h3>Learning after work</h3>\n<p>If you&#39;re determined enough to learn you can do that after work by yourself. This obviously has a multitude of drawbacks. I don&#39;t recommend it, make sure you have used every opportunity for learning at work first. After finishing something try to seek mentors online as it&#39;s always better to have your work reviewed.<a href=\"https://awesome-testing.com/2016/06/how-to-become-software-tester.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here</a>is a decent list of helpful online communities.</p><p>I&#39;ll give you two recommended learning paths. I chose Java, Selenium, and Rest-Assured because they have a multitude of online tutorials. If you happen to know any other language use it. In case you get stuck use Google to find solutions.<br>There would be plenty of them available.</p><p><strong>Path 1 - GUI Automation with Selenium</strong></p><p>1. Learn the basics of programming language first - preferably with <a href=\"http://javafortesters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java for Testers</a><br>book.</p><p>2. Learn the basics of Selenium - preferably with <a href=\"http://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Guru99 Selenium</a><br>course.</p><p>3. Start writing real tests on the existing website, for example,<a href=\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/Â </a></p><p>4. Make sure you understand how Maven/Gradle, TestNG/Junit work.</p><p><strong>Path 2 - REST API Automation with Rest-Assured</strong></p><p>1. Learn the basics of programming language first - preferably with<a href=\"http://javafortesters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java for Testers</a>book</p><p>2. Learn HTTP protocol with<a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565925090.d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HTTP: The definitive guide</a></p><p>3. Learn about REST API - Microsoft has recently published its <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">API Guide</a> with useful links</p><p>4. Learn Rest-Assured with <a href=\"http://www.baeldung.com/rest-assured-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baeldung</a>, <a href=\"http://testdetective.com/rest-assured-framework-overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test Detective</a><br>or some different guide (there is plenty of them)</p><p>5. Write tests against real API.<br>Check <a href=\"https://awesome-testing.com/2016/07/restful-api-testing-with-rest-assured-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my post</a>which you can use as a reference.</p><p>6. Make sure you understand how Maven/Gradle, TestNG/Junit work.</p><p>After completing those two paths you shouldn&#39;t have problems finding a new &amp; better job.</p>"
