Recent layoffs in Big Tech companies such as Twitter, Google, and Spotify have highlighted the<br>importance of employability for IT specialists. These layoffs have shown that even highly skilled and experienced<br>professionals can be affected by changes in the industry or company-specific issues. Therefore, it is crucial for IT<br>specialists to be aware of their employability and to take steps to improve it.</p>\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that, despite any advertising or rhetoric about a &quot;family atmosphere&quot; or the importance<br>of employee well-being, companies ultimately prioritize protecting their business. While a positive work environment and<br>employee well-being are certainly important, they may take a backseat when it comes to making decisions that affect the<br>company&#39;s bottom line. Additionally, it is important to keep an open mind about job opportunities, even if they may not<br>align with your ideal work environment or company culture.</p>\n<p>For some reason, open discussions about employability seem to be a taboo topic in many work cultures. I find this<br>strange, as being aware of one&#39;s employability can lead to a sense of agency and control over one&#39;s career. This, in<br>turn, can increase the employee&#39;s well-being and foster a positive attachment to the company.</p>\n<p>An employable software engineer in testing is a professional who possesses the necessary skills, knowledge, and<br>experience to excel in the role of testing software systems. In today&#39;s highly competitive job market, employability is<br>a crucial factor for both job seekers and employers. In the field of software engineering, employability is determined<br>by a combination of technical skills, soft skills, experience, and luck.</p>\n<p>Technical skills are essential for a Software Engineer in Test. This includes knowledge of programming languages,<br>software development methodologies, and testing tools and techniques. In addition, a good software engineer in test<br>should have a strong understanding of software design and architecture, as well as the ability to write clean and<br>maintainable code. Test methodologies such as unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, and regression<br>testing are also important. Automation is becoming more and more important in software testing, so it is essential for<br>software engineers in test to have experience with test automation frameworks and tools, such<br>as <a href=\"https://www.cantest.it/cypress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Cypress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.awesome-testing.com/2023/01/superest-api-testing-library.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Supertest</a>,<br>and <a href=\"https://www.awesome-testing.com/2023/01/maximizing-performance-with-gatling.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gatling</a>. Bug tracking and test<br>management tools such as Jira (+ extensions), TestRail, and TestLink are also important.</p>\n<p>Soft skills are also crucial for a Software Engineer in Test. These include communication skills, problem-solving<br>abilities, ability to work well in a team, self-reliance, and assertiveness. A software engineer in test must be able to<br>communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and to work collaboratively with other<br>members of the development team to ensure that software meets quality standards.</p>\n<p>Employers often seek candidates with a significant amount of hands-on experience. For individuals seeking their first<br>job in the IT industry, this is often considered the most important factor. Other considerations include formal<br>education and certifications, but their relevance may vary.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, employability is a crucial aspect for Software Engineers in Test. To be considered employable, a<br>candidate must possess the necessary technical skills, soft skills, and relevant experience to excel in the role of<br>testing software systems. Employers seek candidates with a combination of formal education, on-the-job experience, and<br>certifications. To improve employability, Software Engineers in Test should focus on continuously developing and<br>expanding their skills, knowledge, and experience, with an emphasis on domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, it&#39;s<br>important to remember that while companies may advertise a &quot;family atmosphere&quot; and prioritize employee well-being,<br>ultimately, protecting the business is the top priority for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable advices to assess your employability:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Find job offers with conditions and salary you aspire to and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assess your technical skills: Evaluate your knowledge and proficiency in programming languages, software development<br>methodologies, and testing tools and techniques.</li>\n<li>Evaluate your soft skills: Assess your communication skills, problem-solving abilities, self-reliance, assertiveness<br>and the ability to work well in a team</li>\n<li>Do you have real examples of the things you’ve done in order to confirm the above? DONE is the key word here. It’s not<br>about the things you have CONSIDERED improving.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Seek feedback from peers, mentors, or former employers you trust. Obtain an unbiased opinion from individuals who<br>have worked with you in the past or are currently working with you.</p>\n"
