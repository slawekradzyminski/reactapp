One such innovation is the use of language models like ChatGPT in test engineering. ChatGPT&#39;s ability to generate text based on patterns it has learned from large amounts of training data has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach testing. In this blog post, we will explore the various ways that ChatGPT could impact the craft of test engineering,<br>including its use in generating test cases, improving test coverage, and automating test maintenance. Whether you are a seasoned test engineer or just starting out, this post will give you a glimpse into the exciting possibilities that ChatGPT offers for the future of testing.</p><p>Here are top 5 examples I use daily in my various freelancing gigs:</p><h3>Test generation</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT has the capability to generate UI test examples in various programming languages such as Selenium/Java,<br>PlayWright/Python, and Cypress/JS. The generated test cases can be used to verify that a specific website or web page is functioning correctly by searching for a keyword, such as &quot;ChatGPT,&quot; and verifying that the website or page is listed in the search results. The examples provided by ChatGPT are designed to be concise, easy to understand, and flexible,<br>allowing developers to quickly and easily create automated UI tests. This capability of ChatGPT can save valuable time and resources for organizations by reducing the need for manual testing and allowing developers to focus on more complex tasks.</p><p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p><p><em>Generate a Selenium/Java, PlayWright/Python, Cypress/JS UI test example that searches for ChatGPT on Bing page and verify that you have been found</em></p><p><em>You have verified the title. Please verify that ChatGPT website is listed in search results. Fix the examples please</em></p><p><strong>Results:</strong></p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.01.50.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.02.09.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.02.16.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n<h3>CI configuration generation</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can provide users with a wide range of possibilities for generating Continuous Integration (CI) configurations.<br>With its advanced language processing capabilities and deep understanding of software engineering practices, ChatGPT can assist users in automating the process of building, testing, and deploying their applications. Whether it&#39;s creating GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, writing scripts to run tests on a build server, or generating Dockerfiles for containerizing applications, ChatGPT can assist with all aspects of CI generation. Additionally, ChatGPT can provide recommendations and best practices for setting up CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that the generated configurations are optimized for maximum efficiency and scalability. This can save developers valuable time and effort, enabling them to focus on writing code and delivering new features to their users.</p><p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p><p><em>Create GitHub Actions configuration that runs Gatling maven tests written in Java. The tests contain maven wrapper and require Java 17. If possible split the the configuration into multiple steps. The first step should use artifact upload action for target folder. The target folder should then be downloaded via appropriate action and tests should be executed via command:</em></p><p><em>mvn gatling:test -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.awesome.testing.BasicSimulation</em></p><p><em>I have made a mistake in the prompt. Please split the configuration into two jobs, not steps. The second one should depend on the first job success</em></p><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.14.58.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n<h3>Tool comparison, advices</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can assist in choosing the right tool for a given task by providing tailored recommendations based on a comprehensive understanding of the task requirements and user preferences. With its advanced language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can analyze the requirements and match them with the strengths and capabilities of various tools,<br>taking into account factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with other tools, reporting and analysis,<br>community and support, and cost. By providing an objective, data-driven evaluation of each tool, ChatGPT can help users make an informed decision and choose the right tool for their specific needs. Additionally, ChatGPT can provide guidance on how to get started with the selected tool, including information on installation, configuration, and best practices,<br>making the tool selection process a seamless and efficient experience for users.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>I need to create performance tests soon and I am currently doing tool research. The team is quite skilled at coding and I would prefer to store tests as a code. After initial research I have identified 4 free tools: JMeter, k6, Locust and Gatling. The team has very mixed programming experience. There is no preference for Python, JS or JVM language. What do you think I should take into account while making a decision?</em></p><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.23.16.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n<h3>Influential writing</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can be used to generate influential and error-free argumentative text by leveraging its advanced natural language processing capabilities and vast database of information. With its ability to analyze and understand complex data, ChatGPT can generate well-researched and logically structured arguments that effectively support a particular viewpoint. Additionally, ChatGPT can identify and eliminate potential errors or inconsistencies in the argument,<br>ensuring that the text is accurate and convincing. Whether you need to write a persuasive essay, a compelling argument for a business proposal, or an influential piece of content, ChatGPT can help you create error-free text that is backed by strong evidence and logic. This makes it a valuable tool for anyone looking to communicate their ideas effectively and make a lasting impact with their writing.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>I&#39;d like to convince my team that Cypress is a better tool for out needs because it is widely used across company and has very low entry level. The team would like to use Playwright in order to learn something new and experiment. I understand that but I&#39;m worried it may take too much time. How do I convince them that Cypress is a better choice for them? Please consider their internal motivation for work. I don&#39;t want them become discouraged and unmotivated for work.</em></p><p><em>Please write a few strong paragraphs. Use the arguments you find the most powerful. Is it better to focus on one major aspect or multitude minor ones? Please decide yourself</em></p><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.32.55.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>Please note error in last sentence :)</p><h3>Creative tasks</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for test engineers looking to generate creative and innovative testing scenarios. With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can assist in generating unique and imaginative test cases, testing scenarios and edge cases that are based on user inputs and information from its vast database. This can help test engineers uncover new testing perspectives and challenge the assumptions of a system, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive and effective testing process. Whether you need to come up with new test cases for a complex application, generate test ideas for a new feature, or identify edge cases that need to be addressed, ChatGPT can help you generate creative testing content that goes beyond the traditional testing methods. Additionally, its ability to understand language and context enables it to generate testing content that is relevant, comprehensive and tailored to the specific needs of the application being tested. Whether you&#39;re a test engineer, QA analyst, or software tester,<br>ChatGPT can help you take your testing process to the next level and deliver better quality software.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>Write testing manifesto in the style of agile manifesto</em></p><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.38.11.png\" alt=\"\">\n"
