One such<br>innovation is the use of language models like ChatGPT in test engineering. ChatGPT&#39;s ability to generate text based on<br>patterns it has learned from large amounts of training data has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach<br>testing. In this blog post, we will explore the various ways that ChatGPT could impact the craft of test engineering,<br>including its use in generating test cases, improving test coverage, and automating test maintenance. Whether you are a<br>seasoned test engineer or just starting out, this post will give you a glimpse into the exciting possibilities that<br>ChatGPT offers for the future of testing.</p>\n<p>Here are top 5 examples I use daily in my various freelancing gigs:</p>\n<h3>Test generation</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT has the capability to generate UI test examples in various programming languages such as Selenium/Java,<br>PlayWright/Python, and Cypress/JS. The generated test cases can be used to verify that a specific website or web page is<br>functioning correctly by searching for a keyword, such as &quot;ChatGPT,&quot; and verifying that the website or page is listed in<br>the search results. The examples provided by ChatGPT are designed to be concise, easy to understand, and flexible,<br>allowing developers to quickly and easily create automated UI tests. This capability of ChatGPT can save valuable time<br>and resources for organizations by reducing the need for manual testing and allowing developers to focus on more complex<br>tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Generate a Selenium/Java, PlayWright/Python, Cypress/JS UI test example that searches for ChatGPT on Bing page and<br>verify that you have been found</em></p>\n<p><em>You have verified the title. Please verify that ChatGPT website is listed in search results. Fix the examples please</em></p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.01.50.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.02.09.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.02.16.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<h3>CI configuration generation</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can provide users with a wide range of possibilities for generating Continuous Integration (CI) configurations.<br>With its advanced language processing capabilities and deep understanding of software engineering practices, ChatGPT can<br>assist users in automating the process of building, testing, and deploying their applications. Whether it&#39;s creating<br>GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, writing scripts to run tests on a build server, or generating Dockerfiles for<br>containerizing applications, ChatGPT can assist with all aspects of CI generation. Additionally, ChatGPT can provide<br>recommendations and best practices for setting up CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that the generated configurations are<br>optimized for maximum efficiency and scalability. This can save developers valuable time and effort, enabling them to<br>focus on writing code and delivering new features to their users.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Create GitHub Actions configuration that runs Gatling maven tests written in Java. The tests contain maven wrapper and<br>require Java 17. If possible split the the configuration into multiple steps. The first step should use artifact upload<br>action for target folder. The target folder should then be downloaded via appropriate action and tests should be<br>executed via command:</em></p>\n<p><em>mvn gatling:test -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.awesome.testing.BasicSimulation</em></p>\n<p><em>I have made a mistake in the prompt. Please split the configuration into two jobs, not steps. The second one should<br>depend on the first job success</em></p>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.14.58.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<h3>Tool comparison, advices</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can assist in choosing the right tool for a given task by providing tailored recommendations based on a<br>comprehensive understanding of the task requirements and user preferences. With its advanced language processing<br>capabilities, ChatGPT can analyze the requirements and match them with the strengths and capabilities of various tools,<br>taking into account factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with other tools, reporting and analysis,<br>community and support, and cost. By providing an objective, data-driven evaluation of each tool, ChatGPT can help users<br>make an informed decision and choose the right tool for their specific needs. Additionally, ChatGPT can provide guidance<br>on how to get started with the selected tool, including information on installation, configuration, and best practices,<br>making the tool selection process a seamless and efficient experience for users.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>\n<p><em>I need to create performance tests soon and I am currently doing tool research. The team is quite skilled at coding and<br>I would prefer to store tests as a code. After initial research I have identified 4 free tools: JMeter, k6, Locust and<br>Gatling. The team has very mixed programming experience. There is no preference for Python, JS or JVM language. What do<br>you think I should take into account while making a decision?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.23.16.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<h3>Influential writing</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can be used to generate influential and error-free argumentative text by leveraging its advanced natural<br>language processing capabilities and vast database of information. With its ability to analyze and understand complex<br>data, ChatGPT can generate well-researched and logically structured arguments that effectively support a particular<br>viewpoint. Additionally, ChatGPT can identify and eliminate potential errors or inconsistencies in the argument,<br>ensuring that the text is accurate and convincing. Whether you need to write a persuasive essay, a compelling argument<br>for a business proposal, or an influential piece of content, ChatGPT can help you create error-free text that is backed<br>by strong evidence and logic. This makes it a valuable tool for anyone looking to communicate their ideas effectively<br>and make a lasting impact with their writing.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>\n<p><em>I&#39;d like to convince my team that Cypress is a better tool for out needs because it is widely used across company and<br>has very low entry level. The team would like to use Playwright in order to learn something new and experiment. I<br>understand that but I&#39;m worried it may take too much time. How do I convince them that Cypress is a better choice for<br>them? Please consider their internal motivation for work. I don&#39;t want them become discouraged and unmotivated for<br>work.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please write a few strong paragraphs. Use the arguments you find the most powerful. Is it better to focus on one major<br>aspect or multitude minor ones? Please decide yourself</em></p>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.32.55.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<p>Please note error in last sentence :)</p>\n<h3>Creative tasks</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for test engineers looking to generate creative and innovative testing scenarios. With<br>its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can assist in generating unique and imaginative test<br>cases, testing scenarios and edge cases that are based on user inputs and information from its vast database. This can<br>help test engineers uncover new testing perspectives and challenge the assumptions of a system, ultimately leading to a<br>more comprehensive and effective testing process. Whether you need to come up with new test cases for a complex<br>application, generate test ideas for a new feature, or identify edge cases that need to be addressed, ChatGPT can help<br>you generate creative testing content that goes beyond the traditional testing methods. Additionally, its ability to<br>understand language and context enables it to generate testing content that is relevant, comprehensive and tailored to<br>the specific needs of the application being tested. Whether you&#39;re a test engineer, QA analyst, or software tester,<br>ChatGPT can help you take your testing process to the next level and deliver better quality software.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Write testing manifesto in the style of agile manifesto</em></p>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2015.38.11.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n"
