  "content": "<img src=\"/images/blog/6c572a85b6e1c6b22f491be92e499dc4.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanAshby04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dan Ashby</a> has recently published a brilliant <a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/technophiletester.hintonweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DansInterviewMindMap.jpg?w=2891\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mind map</a><br>which he uses for interviewing software testers. Unfortunately,<br>his <a href=\"https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/how-i-interview-testers-with-dan-ashby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">full talk</a> requires quite an expensive subscription and I wasn&#39;t able to watch it. This gave me however an idea to post some original job interview tips, which I believe may strongly supplement typical stuff (like not showing up too early/late, maintaining eye contact and not acting weird). You can find a nice &amp; short etiquette guide <a href=\"http://www.gcflearnfree.org/interviewingskills/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>As usual a word of caution: don&#39;t treat those points as universal and sacred truths. Every situation is different and may require custom preparation. Have in mind the cultural difference between countries too.</p><h2>Part I - Research</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Personal brand on Google</strong> - it still amazes me how little awareness some people have regarding their presence on the Web. Have in mind that your name will most likely be Googled before an interview,<br>and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impression_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the first impression</a>may be formed even before an interview. Don&#39;t post drunk or half-naked photos on publicly available social media profiles. Keep professional profile on LinkedIn up-to-date and check your name regularly in Google. You can easily change the result by doing some work once. It&#39;s not like it requires continuous attention. Great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ROI</a><br>here.</p><p><strong>2. Workplace</strong> - You should know a lot about the company you apply to. In Google era it&#39;s pretty simple and ignoring these points means you don&#39;t really care (or you&#39;re sloppy which is even worse). For example, before the Ocado interview, I found an article about robotics. It&#39;s now pushed down in results be <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-06/10/ocado-secondhands-collaborative-robot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a newer article</a> so I can&#39;t give you the exact link. Focus on something interesting, don&#39;t try to memorize the CEO name.</p><p><strong>3. Workplace culture &amp; values</strong> - I was wondering if it should be separated from point 2, but in my opinion, it requires some special attention. Best companies require quick learners (<br>see <a href=\"https://awesome-testing.com/2016/03/learning-pathways-for-testers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my Learning Pathways post</a>) and ambitious candidates. Make sure you know the recruitment criteria before. Sometimes it&#39;s as simple as asking your recruiter. Try to reach someone who works in the company you&#39;re trying to join and ask him/her too.</p><h2>Part II - Knowledge</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Present your skills with confidence</strong> - Cristiano Ronaldo has recently been <a href=\"http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2357287.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">interviewed by UEFA</a> and he confidently said that he already secured placed in football history. Even though you may not like it, don&#39;t be falsely modest. If you know you&#39;re good show it. Be careful though with &#39;expert&#39; word in your CV. We tend to overestimate our skills. Everyone thinks that they&#39;re <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/everyone-thinks-they-are-above-average/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">above average</a>. Daniel Kahneman&#39;s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>may help you properly estimate your knowledge.</p><p><strong>2. Be honest with your flaws</strong> - No one is perfect. Simple as that. If you don&#39;t know the answer to a question admit that and try to figure out an answer. Remember that working with people who honestly pick up their tasks is much easier.<br>Requirements for a job position are usually inflated, so you don&#39;t have to meet them in 100%. Never lie - that&#39;s probably the worst thing you can do on a job interview.</p><p><strong>3. Be aware that things you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know exist -</strong> Terrible linguistic construct.<br>Watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CUHeUkQHes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this video</a>and checking the image below may be helpful here.</p><img src=\"/images/blog/Knowledge-Matrix.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>Most people focus on things they know they know (that&#39;s probably why we tend to overestimate our knowledge). Don&#39;t be like everyone else and focus on other quadrants. Experiment, read, learn. Don&#39;t be afraid to show that approach to job interviews.</p><p>Good luck :)</p>"
