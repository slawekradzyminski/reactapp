  "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blog/Learning-Quotes-16-of-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<p>Usually, when I look online for learning resources I find a lot of rankings like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top 10 blogs every tester should follow</li>\n<li>Top 5 sites every tester should know</li>\n<li>Top 20 Twitter account for every professional tester</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Almost always those ranking contain top hits from Google + one entry which happen to be closely related with the ranking<br>source. Associating yourself with the best is really smart from a marketing perspective (and I actually may do that<br>myself one day), but it&#39;s surely not what I was looking for. In this post, I want to provide a more thorough examination<br>of the learning topic.</p>\n<p>Text will contain 3 parts, which are ordered by, importance level - motivation, learning at work and learning after<br>work. Each section contains action points to consider (same style as<br>in <a href=\"http://awesome-bookreviews.blogspot.com/2016/03/lean-software-development-agile-toolkit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</a>).<br>Note that those are not universal truths. You need to map them to your style of work and project reality.</p>\n<p>You can probably apply those advices to different computer science field as well.</p>\n<h2>Part I - Motivation</h2>\n<p>Surely the most important one. You may have the best resources available, best people around, but still, it&#39;s not enough<br>unless you are willing to learn.</p>\n<p><strong>Like what you&#39;re doing</strong></p>\n<p>Robert Greene in <a href=\"http://awesome-bookreviews.blogspot.com/2016/01/mastery-robert-greene.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mastery</a> wrote &#39;<em>To master<br>a field, you must love the field and feel a profound connection to it&#39;</em>. I can&#39;t imagine going to work every day with a<br>negative attitude. Save yourself tortures and find a job that you like (or at least tolerate).</p>\n<p><strong>Adopt a beginner&#39;s mind approach and don&#39;t be afraid of failure.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#39;m always impressed by how young kids are skiing. They carefully listen to their coaches and try to adopt advice<br>instantly with full trust. In rare cases when they fell on the ground they just stand up and start riding again. No<br>complaints. No second thoughts. We should strive to adopt the same approach. If you are interested in this subject read<br>Ryan<br>Holiday&#39;s <a href=\"http://awesome-bookreviews.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-obstacle-is-way-ryan-holiday.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Obstacle Is the Way</a><br>book.</p>\n<p><strong>Find a company which embraces learning</strong><br>This has a lot in common with something I wrote already on my blogs - you should always aim at working with people<br>smarter than you. If you notice that your every change proposals are discouraged or laughed off consider changing your<br>peers. It doesn&#39;t have to be company change, internal project switch may be good enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Find a company that pays you well and doesn&#39;t use the money to motivate you.</strong></p>\n<p>Do not pretend that money is not important. In my opinion, you should aim at earning above average. How to define<br>average? It&#39;s your subjective amount of how much people on your position, with the same experience, should earn. Money<br>shouldn&#39;t be used as a motivational carrot. As Daniel Pink wrote in his great<br>book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Drive</a>(add to wish list if you haven&#39;t<br>read it already) extrinsic motivation has negative effects.</p>\n<h2>Part II - Learning at work</h2>\n<p>Dorota Wojtałów wrote in<br>her <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dorotawojtalow/learn-learn-learn-but-what-when-and-how-318b099d1808#.b24xj9w4i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Medium post</a><br>that &#39;a_t work, you have almost 8 hours of practical experiences — 8 hours which can be filled in with learning new<br>stuff._&#39; Wholeheartedly agree. No need to add anything.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#39;t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone</strong></p>\n<p>I dedicate this point to every manual tester who wants to start automating. Writing code isn&#39;t really that hard,<br>especially today when we have so many books and online resources available. Don&#39;t be afraid to pick up DevOps tasks as<br>well. Treat it as a free learning opportunity (you&#39;ll work 8 you hours anyway, so why don&#39;t you do something new?).</p>\n<p><strong>Try to see the world from peers eyes</strong></p>\n<p>Most software testing books focus on testing activities only. In an Agile world we are all team members with one simple<br>goal (remember my <a href=\"https://awesome-testing.com/2016/03/mapping-lean-principles-to-testing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">last post</a>?): delivery<br>of the right product. We should focus more on projects than testing. Ask when necessary what&#39;s expected from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask for &amp; give feedback</strong></p>\n<p>This is not easy, especially when it comes to the negative one. However, it&#39;s really beneficial for us, projects &amp; the<br>whole company. Don&#39;t forget about positive feedback too - it may even make occasional negative ones more influential.<br>Read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-A-Language-Life/dp/1892005034\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nonviolent communication</a> if you&#39;re<br>interested in the subject.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#39;t procrastinate</strong></p>\n<p>TODO... ;)</p>\n<h2>Part III - Learning after work</h2>\n<p>Every intellectual &amp; well-paid job requires some learning after working hours. Simple as that. No exceptions here.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#39;t work too much</strong><br>It may surprise you, but <a href=\"https://lengstorf.com/overtime-hurts-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">overtime actually decreases productivity</a>.<br>If your company has something I call &#39;overtime culture&#39; (social pressure to stay at work more than 8 hours) try to kill<br>it by introducing new, more healthy, working trends. The same applies to read &amp; learning at home. No need to do it<br>always. Find some time for friends, family &amp; dogs. Dogs are awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>Make reading your habit</strong><br>Books are awesome too. Start reading every day, on various topics. If you are tired of technology go for something<br>lightweight (I like post-apocalyptic books<br>like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/World-War-Oral-History-Zombie/dp/0307346617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">World War Z</a><br>or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Metro-2033-Dmitry-Glukhovsky-ebook/dp/B003774XKG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1458474296&sr=1-1&keywords=metro+2033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Metro 2033</a>).<br>Consistency is the key. If you read every day you will end up with the reading habit, and as Charles Duhigg wrote<br>in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&#39;The power of habit&#39;</a>they&#39;re hard to change. Take<br>advantage of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Expand your knowledge in various fields</strong><br>In one of my previous posts, I stated<br>that <a href=\"https://awesome-testing.com/2015/11/ideal-tester-equals-3141592.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ideal tester equals 3,14</a>. Keep that in mind<br>and don&#39;t read testing books only. Expand your knowledge in programming, DevOps, management, UX, security, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Be critical in choosing sources you follow</strong></p>\n<p>Our day is limited to 24 hours only. You can&#39;t follow every single resource available online and read every book. Be<br>critical and follow the ones you consider smarter than you. Generally speaking, internationally recognized authors are<br>almost always better than local. Read in original language (usually English) to avoid translation<br>confusion. <a href=\"http://adventuresinqa.com/2016/03/16/reading-recommendations-54/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Blog aggregators</a> (top posts from last<br>week) may be helpful here.</p>\n"
