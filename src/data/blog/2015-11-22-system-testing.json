  "content": "<p>More than two years ago I was invited to a System Tester job interview in Motorola. As usual, I wanted to prepare as well as possible and by simple googling, I made a surprising discovery. In the world where almost everything has detailed descriptions available for free, there is serious lack of reliable resources about &#39;system testing&#39;. For example, on Amazon, there is only one sensible hit -&gt; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Verification-Validation-Testing-Engineered-Systems/dp/047052751X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">check it</a>. Trust me, by implementing processes described in this book you will end up broken. This means that you can become a bestselling author. Just write a professional and concise book about system testing with lots of practical examples.</p><p>According to ISTQB glossary, system testing is the process of testing an integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements. That&#39;s too general description. In my opinion:</p><p>System testing in the time &amp; budget-limited process which ensures that:</p><ul>\n<li>the system meets specified requirements</li>\n<li>all system elements integrate correctly making desired *ility levels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#39;s fashionable to analyze what Apple does, so let&#39;s check scraps of information we can find online. Before launching iPhone 6 Apple opened the testing center in Cupertino for the press. I managed to find an absolutely fascinating picture-rich article about iPhone testing (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6845611/inside-apples-iphone-6-torture-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">click</a>). Unfortunately,<br>those are only hardware tests. If you use Apple products you probably agree that the usability levels are very high. It looks like they hire Human Factor Engineers (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/70768850?trk=jserp_job_details_text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">click</a>). However, this looks the most interesting (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/72883772?trk=jserp_job_details_text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">click</a>) - is it iPhone System Tester? Those are job requirements:</p><ul>\n<li>Testing of mobile devices and cellular technologies (GSM/GPRS/CDMA/LTE/etc)</li>\n<li>Scripting skills in any of the following: Python, Perl, Shell, or JavaScript</li>\n<li>Good understanding of SQA methodologies &amp; practices</li>\n<li>Comfortable with working on hardware and in supporting engineering in debugging and reproducing user case scenario</li>\n<li>Demonstrated ability to own a complete functional area of an application or product</li>\n<li>Thrive in a collaborative environment and can clearly communicate while confidently driving multiple projects across many teams</li>\n<li>Obsessively passionate and inquisitive, and seek to solve everyday problems in innovative ways</li>\n<li>Laser-focused on the smallest details that are meaningful to our customers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully one day a brilliant writer will answer millions of system testing questions - how to test a pacemaker? How to test a space shuttle? When to start integration? When to start performance testing? Which test types to rely on? And so it goes!</p>"
