Maybe because of that I hear a lot of questions like: &#39;how to become a software tester?&#39;. Today I&#39;d like to answer them and compile good advice (at least in my opinion) in one place.</p><p>Throughout the post, I&#39;ll use a lot of quotes from &#39;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Google Tests Software</a>&#39; book. I also recommend posts from <a href=\"https://www.blacksintechnology.net/career-advice-for-entry-level-software-testers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blacksintechnology</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guru99.com/software-testing-career-complete-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">guru99</a>, <a href=\"http://m.rediff.com/getahead/report/career-why-are-soft-skills-so-important/20150529.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reddif</a>, <a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/249714/importance-english-employment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">deccanherald</a><br>and last but not least, <a href=\"http://awesome-testing.com/2016/02/dos-and-donts-for-testers-2016-edition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my blog</a>(but have in mind that it was written for testers with some experience already).</p><p>As usual, a word of caution (which you should adopt for everything btw): those are just my views, they don&#39;t have to true for you and your environment. The order is pseudorandom.</p><p><strong>Education</strong></p><blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>Google takes hiring engineers seriously. In general, our engineers have computer science or related degrees from</p><p></p><p>accredited universities.</p><p></p></blockquote><p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Google Tests Software</a></em></p><p>A highly controversial topic makes a lot of people agitated and emotional. From my experience though testers with computer science background are indeed better (and I&#39;m not the only with such opinion).</p><p>Now imagine you don&#39;t have any IT education and you are being recruited by someone like me. Every job interview would be an uphill battle for you. You would have to prove more skills than your peers just because they are not confirmed by &#39;<br>accredited university&#39; yet.</p><blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>Today we interview for general computer science and technical skills combined with a strong requirement for testing</p><p></p><p>aptitude.</p><p></p></blockquote><p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Google Tests Software</a></em></p><p>Place yourself in pole position and graduate. As Sun Tzu said <a href=\"http://suntzusaid.com/book/7/33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fighting an uphill battle</a> is never a good idea.</p><p><strong>Learn English</strong></p><blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>The reality is that the companies consider the candidate’s ability or inability to speak fluently in English as one of</p><p></p><p>the major selection criterion.</p><p></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/249714/importance-english-employment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>deccanherald.com</em></a></p><p>Obvious one. It&#39;s true especially for testers which often have to not only play with the system under test but also actively cooperate with product owners, programmers, managers, etc.</p><p>Remember that learning English doesn&#39;t have to be boring. Make it fun by reading books, watching sport, and TV shows in English (preferably with English subtitles). Some cities have something like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/lec.krakow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&#39;Language Exchange Club&#39;</a>where you can meet people and train foreign language.</p><p><strong>Avoid naysayers and doubters</strong></p><blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>One of the dangers newcomers face in any industry are “broken” and “settled” employees.</p><p></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.blacksintechnology.net/career-advice-for-entry-level-software-testers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blacksintechnology.net</a></p><p>Interesting topic. Generally speaking, if we are committing ourselves to something ambitious (like becoming software engineers) there will be people who will show skepticism, doubt, and worries. You need to ignore them and find mentors instead (see point 9).

I know people who have very high technical skills but are just terrible when it comes to effective communication.</p><p>Our society discourages honesty in this area (because it may hurt someone else&#39;s feelings) so until you&#39;re hired and trusted employee don&#39;t expect any feedback. You have to be aware of its importance and analyze your failures on your own.

Pick any language you want, for example, Java. Start with general programming skills and move to Selenium after that. My recommendation would be:</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://javafortesters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java for Testers</a> by Alan Richardson</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Guru99 Selenium course</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Get yourself interested in the testing community</strong></p><blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>We are looking for innate curiosity about how things are built and what combinations of variables and configurations</p><p></p><p>are possible and interesting to test.</p><p></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>How Google Tests Software</em></a></p><p>If you want to be a good tester you need to at least like your profession. It&#39;s very important to show that interest during a job interview.

It may be hard before getting your first job, but if you don&#39;t know anyone you can look for them online (see point 7), or meetup (see point 10). Make sure you have indeed found a smarter person.

It&#39;s wonderful place to learn something new and find people with common interests. Don&#39;t leave right after official part ends, sometimes (actually, pretty often) you can learn more during informal post-meeting discussions influenced by a beer :)</p><p>Conferences are also great, I&#39;m going to <a href=\"https://qualityexcites.pl/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Quality Excites</a> next week.
