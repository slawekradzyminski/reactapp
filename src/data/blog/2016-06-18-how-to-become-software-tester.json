Maybe because of that I hear a lot of questions like: &#39;how to become a software tester?&#39;. Today I&#39;d like<br>to answer them and compile good advice (at least in my opinion) in one place.</p>\n<p>Throughout the post, I&#39;ll use a lot of quotes<br>from &#39;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Google Tests Software</a>&#39; book. I<br>also recommend posts<br>from <a href=\"https://www.blacksintechnology.net/career-advice-for-entry-level-software-testers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blacksintechnology</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guru99.com/software-testing-career-complete-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">guru99</a>, <a href=\"http://m.rediff.com/getahead/report/career-why-are-soft-skills-so-important/20150529.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reddif</a>, <a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/249714/importance-english-employment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">deccanherald</a><br>and last but not least, <a href=\"http://awesome-testing.com/2016/02/dos-and-donts-for-testers-2016-edition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my blog</a>(but<br>have in mind that it was written for testers with some experience already).</p>\n<p>As usual, a word of caution (which you should adopt for everything btw): those are just my views, they don&#39;t have to<br>true for you and your environment. The order is pseudorandom.</p>\n<p><strong>Education</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>Google takes hiring engineers seriously. In general, our engineers have computer science or related degrees from</p><p>accredited universities.  </p></p></blockquote><p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Google Tests Software</a></em></p>\n<p>A highly controversial topic makes a lot of people agitated and emotional. From my experience though testers with<br>computer science background are indeed better (and I&#39;m not the only with such opinion).</p>\n<p>Now imagine you don&#39;t have any IT education and you are being recruited by someone like me. Every job interview would be<br>an uphill battle for you. You would have to prove more skills than your peers just because they are not confirmed by &#39;<br>accredited university&#39; yet.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>Today we interview for general computer science and technical skills combined with a strong requirement for testing</p><p>aptitude.  </p></p></blockquote><p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Google Tests Software</a></em></p>\n<p>Place yourself in pole position and graduate. As Sun Tzu<br>said <a href=\"http://suntzusaid.com/book/7/33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fighting an uphill battle</a> is never a good idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn English</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>The reality is that the companies consider the candidate’s ability or inability to speak fluently in English as one of</p><p>the major selection criterion.  </p></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/249714/importance-english-employment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>deccanherald.com</em></a></p>\n<p>Obvious one. It&#39;s true especially for testers which often have to not only play with the system under test but also<br>actively cooperate with product owners, programmers, managers, etc.</p>\n<p>Remember that learning English doesn&#39;t have to be boring. Make it fun by reading books, watching sport, and TV shows in<br>English (preferably with English subtitles). Some cities have something<br>like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/lec.krakow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&#39;Language Exchange Club&#39;</a>where you can meet people and train foreign<br>language.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid naysayers and doubters</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>One of the dangers newcomers face in any industry are “broken” and “settled” employees.  </p></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.blacksintechnology.net/career-advice-for-entry-level-software-testers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blacksintechnology.net</a></p>\n<p>Interesting topic. Generally speaking, if we are committing ourselves to something ambitious (like becoming software<br>engineers) there will be people who will show skepticism, doubt, and worries. You need to ignore them and find mentors<br>instead (see point 9).

I know people who<br>have very high technical skills but are just terrible when it comes to effective communication.</p>\n<p>Our society discourages honesty in this area (because it may hurt someone else&#39;s feelings) so until you&#39;re hired and<br>trusted employee don&#39;t expect any feedback. You have to be aware of its importance and analyze your failures on your<br>own.

Foundation Level is pretty<br>easy so it shouldn&#39;t be a too big time investment. Learn basic vocabulary and try to understand basic concepts.</p>\n<p><strong>Work on programming skills</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>Knowledge of coding is necessary but tends toward the coding skills necessary for {...} the modification of code over</p><p>its creation and the ability to script end-to-end user scenarios.  </p></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>How Google Tests Software</em> </a></p>\n<p>Most of the testing jobs these days require test automation skills (some testers call it to check automation, but don&#39;t<br>bother about it now). Pick any language you want, for example, Java. Start with general programming skills and move to<br>Selenium after that. My recommendation would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://javafortesters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java for Testers</a> by Alan Richardson</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Guru99 Selenium course</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Get yourself interested in the testing community</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>We are looking for innate curiosity about how things are built and what combinations of variables and configurations</p><p>are possible and interesting to test.  </p></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>How Google Tests Software</em></a></p>\n<p>If you want to be a good tester you need to at least like your profession. It&#39;s very important to show that interest<br>during a job interview. The biggest international testing communities can be found:</p>\n<p>a) On Slack -&gt; <a href=\"http://www.testers.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">testers.io </a></p>\n<p>b) On Ministry of Testing -&gt; <a href=\"http://www.ministryoftesting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ministryoftesting.com</a></p>\n<p>c) On Twitter -&gt; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/s_radzyminski/following\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I follow quite a few of them</a></p>\n<p><strong>Read books about Software Engineering</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"blog-quote\"><p>Test Engineers are rare individuals.

It may be hard before getting your first job, but if you don&#39;t know anyone you can<br>look for them online (see point 7), or meetup (see point 10).

It&#39;s wonderful place to learn something new and find people with common interests. Don&#39;t leave<br>right after official part ends, sometimes (actually, pretty often) you can learn more during informal post-meeting<br>discussions influenced by a beer :)</p>\n<p>Conferences are also great, I&#39;m going to <a href=\"https://qualityexcites.pl/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Quality Excites</a> next week. See you there!</p>\n"
