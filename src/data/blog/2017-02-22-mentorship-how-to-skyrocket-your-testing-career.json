  "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blog/MtBrighton_5212.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<p>In my recent posts focused on <a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/search/label/learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">learning</a> I put much attention on<br>mentorship importance. I listed it as one of the points<br>in <a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2016/06/how-to-become-software-tester.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">how to become a software tester</a>and<br>described it as one of the most effective ways<br>of <a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2016/08/how-to-start-learning-test-automation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">learning how to automate tests</a>.<br>When I was skiing last week in the Alps I decided to explain it in detail. Seeing post picture you probably already know<br>what view triggered that.</p>\n<p>When kids learn how to ski they follow trainer&#39;s route. He teaches them everything: how to stop, how to turn and even<br>how to crash. It doesn&#39;t occur to them to take different route and start learning on their own. I recommend you to do<br>the same when it comes to software testing (or any other IT job). Follow the path of wise mentor and take full advantage<br>of his broad knowledge. As I&#39;ll explain in point 4 this is win-win situation for both of you.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of having a mentor</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re willing to learn novice you can quickly improve your job market value. Here is the list of the most important<br>benefits:</p>\n<p><em>a) Short feedback loop</em></p>\n<p>One of the most important <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2kChQs6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lean startup</a> principle says that whenever you create something new (<br>test case, automated test code, blog post, business etc.) you should gather feedback as fast as possible and act on it.<br>This of course isn&#39;t always nice - you have to show some courage and open yourself for criticism. With mentor sitting<br>close to you constructive remarks are almost immediate and you<br>can <a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2017/01/testops-4-continuous-improvement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">improve continuously</a>.</p>\n<p><em>b) Easy knowledge gap identification</em></p>\n<p>By observing what skills you lack comparable to your mentor you can identify your knowledge gaps. This allows you<br>to <a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2016/03/learning-pathways-for-testers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">work on those skills</a>, for example after<br>work. First step is much easier - you can ask for good knowledge sources or live training.</p>\n<p><em>c) Fixing annoying and time consuming blockers</em></p>\n<p>I&#39;m pretty sure it happened to you many times. You start doing something new, follow tutorial step by step, but this<br>damn thing for some reason just doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s like Tomb Raider riddle which takes you 2 days to figure out.<br>Stackoverflow sometimes (very rarely) fail to deliver correct solution. With mentors and their better understanding on<br>how things work internally you have a person that can quickly fix your weird problems. You save impressive amount of<br>time.</p>\n<h2>What traits make ideal mentor?</h2>\n<p>Not everyone with broad knowledge is good mentor candidate. Effective coach should be:</p>\n<p><em>a) Likeable/easygoing</em></p>\n<p>Obvious one. You don&#39;t want someone weird teaching you. Ideally he should understand the importance of soft skills and<br>help you improve them too.</p>\n<p><em>b) Respectable</em></p>\n<p>Master - novice dynamic is very peculiar. As someone being trained you acknowledge master&#39;s superiority. This doesn&#39;t<br>make you worse person than him though. You&#39;re just less skilled employee and should be treated with respect by everyone,<br>including your master.</p>\n<p><em>c) Good at explaining how things work</em></p>\n<p>As someone who finished various schools you probably know that few teachers just don&#39;t have ability to share knowledge.<br>Make sure time you spend with your mentor is more beneficial than reading random tutorial on the Internet.</p>\n<p><em>d) Internally motivated</em></p>\n<p>Mentors should have self-interest in teaching you. Some companies encourage that by listing coaching in senior<br>engineering job description. However smart people usually understand benefits of being a mentor (see point 4) and in<br>companies with healthy culture almost everyone is willing to teach you.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of being a mentor</h2>\n<p>Effective mentorship should create mutual benefits. Impact on trainees have already been described in point 2. What<br>about the other side?</p>\n<p><em>a) Better understanding of how things work internally</em></p>\n<p>Whenever I explain something to someone (or write blog post here) I had to dig deeper and make sure my understanding of<br>how things work is complete. This really helps to internalise such knowledge and remember it forever. Try it and you<br>would be surprised how many things you already use every day have to be rechecked.</p>\n<p><em>b) Higher chances for promotion at work</em></p>\n<p>Contrary to broken school system at work we all have common goal. People who share their knowledge with others give<br>company the most. They not only work on their tasks, but also help their peers to improve. Try it and you may earn<br>yourself a higher position.</p>\n<p><em>c) Huge improvement of job market value</em></p>\n<p>I&#39;m getting a lot of job offers which list &#39;guidance for the other QAs&#39; or &#39;running workshops and training sessions with<br>developers&#39;. Testing role is changing and soon top jobs would list mentoring skills as prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>I have stated it few times already on this blog, but would do that again. Remember to always surround yourself with<br>people smarter than you. If you&#39;re the best tester in your company perhaps it&#39;s time to expand your knowledge in other<br>area (security, devops) or move on. Always<br>have <a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2017/01/testops-4-continuous-improvement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Continuous Improvement</a> in mind.</p>\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\n<p>Blog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2016/03/learning-pathways-for-testers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Learning pathways for testers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2016/06/how-to-become-software-tester.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How to become software tester</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.awesome-testing.com/2016/08/how-to-start-learning-test-automation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How to start learning test automation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Book:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2l7dUTA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mastery by Robert Greene</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\n<p>I recently created <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AwesomeTestingBlog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Facebook fanpage</a> for my blog.
