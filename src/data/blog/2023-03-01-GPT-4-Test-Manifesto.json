  "content": "<p>I am thrilled to share with you the Test Manifesto, a remarkable example of the unparalleled reasoning powers of the latest generation of language models. As a technology enthusiast, I have been utterly blown away by the advanced capabilities and nuanced understanding demonstrated in the creation of this manifesto. In this blog post, I am excited to showcase this impressive AI-generated artifact, which offers a fresh and insightful perspective on software testing principles. Join me as we delve into the world of cutting-edge AI technology and explore the future of software testing through the lens of this groundbreaking innovation.</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/gpt4yoda.png &quot;GPT4 Yoda&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;gpt4 yoda&quot;&gt;</p><h2>Test Manifesto</h2>\n<p>We are uncovering better ways of testing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:</p><p><strong>Collaboration over isolation</strong></p><p>We believe that effective testing is achieved through continuous collaboration among cross-functional team members. We prioritise open communication and active involvement of developers, testers, and stakeholders in the testing process to ensure the highest quality of the end product.</p><p><strong>Adaptability over rigidity</strong></p><p>In an ever-changing software landscape, we embrace the need for adaptability in our testing approach. We value the ability to respond to changing requirements and new information, allowing for continuous improvement in our testing methodologies and practices.</p><p><strong>Customer-centricity over compliance</strong></p><p>We prioritize the needs and expectations of our customers and users above all else. We strive to ensure that our testing efforts are focused on delivering software that provides value, satisfaction, and meets the expectations of the end-users.</p><p><strong>Context-driven testing over prescriptive processes</strong></p><p>We understand that each software project is unique and requires a tailored testing approach. We believe in using our knowledge, experience, and expertise to design testing strategies that best suit the specific context of each project,<br>rather than blindly following a one-size-fits-all process.</p><p><strong>Continuous learning over static knowledge</strong></p><p>We are committed to constantly expanding our knowledge and improving our testing skills. We actively seek out opportunities for learning, experimentation, and innovation to stay current with industry best practices and emerging technologies.</p><p><strong>Empowered testers over hierarchical control</strong></p><p>We recognize the importance of empowering testers with the autonomy to make informed decisions and take ownership of their work. By fostering a culture of trust and collaboration, we enable our testers to take initiative, learn from mistakes, and continuously improve their testing skills.</p><p><strong>Measurable results over exhaustive documentation</strong></p><p>While we value the importance of documentation, we prioritize measurable results and actionable insights from our testing efforts. We focus on providing meaningful, timely, and relevant feedback that drives the development process forward and supports decision-making.</p><p><strong>Intelligent automation over manual repetition</strong></p><p>We acknowledge the power of test automation in enhancing efficiency, consistency, and scalability of our testing efforts. We prioritize the smart integration of automation in our testing strategies, leveraging it to perform repetitive tasks and complex test scenarios, while allowing testers to focus on exploratory testing and critical thinking. Our automation efforts are guided by maintainability, reusability, and adaptability to ensure the long-term success and value of our automated test suites.</p><p>By following these principles, we aim to create a testing culture that fosters collaboration, continuous improvement,<br>and customer satisfaction, ultimately leading to the delivery of high-quality software products.</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/gpt4vader.png &quot;GPT4 Darth Vader&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;gpt4 vader&quot;&gt;</p><h3>ChatGPT Prompts</h3>\n<p><em>Create test manifesto in the style of agile manifesto</em></p><p><em>Can you add point designed specifically for test automation? It seems to be missing in the list</em></p><p><em>So I&#39;m going to title this post GPT-4 test manifesto. Can you please write an introductory paragraph mentioning that I&#39;m blown away by GPT-4 reasoning powers and wanted to share it on my blog</em></p><p><em>Please rewrite it not mentioned OpenAI</em></p><p><em>Write a LinkedIn post which will advertise this post. Mention that I share real ChatGPT prompts allowing using to extend their prompt engineering knowledge. Optimise it for the maximum reach</em></p><p><em>Now create a twit</em></p><p><em>List tags so that I don&#39;t have to think about it</em></p><p><em>Create SEO friendly text (up to 150 chars)</em></p><h3>Midjourney prompts</h3>\n<p><em>/imagine prompt Artificial intelligence mixed with yoda from star wars</em></p><p><em>/imagine prompt darth vader from star wars using laptop</em></p>"
