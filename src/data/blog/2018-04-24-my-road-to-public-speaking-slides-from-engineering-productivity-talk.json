In order to achieve anything in life we have to conquer own fears<br>first. On Monday (23th of April) I had a privilege to speak<br>about <a href=\"https://www.awesome-testing.com/2017/07/testops-5-engineering-productivity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Engineering Productivity</a> during<br>KraQA meetup. To be honest it wasn&#39;t easy. It&#39;s fair to say that I have conquered myself there.</p>\n<h3>Road</h3>\n<p>The story begins few years ago when I have started blogging. Things written here can be used as framework &amp; background<br>for future talks. It opened my eyes for public speaking opportunities. I though I was ready for theoretical point of<br>view, I saw my testing thoughts valuable for listeners, but I was afraid of big crowd looking at me.</p>\n<p>Then out of nowhere I noticed that <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/KraQA-pl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">KraQA</a>(testing meetup located in Kraków) is<br>looking for help. At first, it wasn&#39;t meant to be a speaking opportunity platform, but I just wanted to help the<br>initiative I like. Thanks to very friendly and relaxed atmosphere on meetups I was able to get familiar with more<br>experienced speakers. I even managed to meet with huge part of my future audience, so I wasn&#39;t speaking to strangers on<br>Monday.</p>\n<p>Third and probably the most important step to my public speaking<br>was <a href=\"http://www.vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/kontynuacja-edukacji/studia-podyplomowe/informatyka/testowanie-oprogramowania/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vistula University</a>.<br>I managed to get hired there as a Java basics course lecturer. Groups there can be as high as 30 people, so I quickly<br>gathered confidence in my speaking and teaching skills. At first, I was doing average job, but acting on good feedback I<br>started gradual improvement.</p>\n<h3>Feedback from my talk</h3>\n<p>Rating myself is probably a bad idea, so I&#39;ll just copy-paste results.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/knowledge.PNG\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/presenting.PNG\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p>\n<p>Probably even with worse ratings I&#39;d be very happy, because as I said already in first paragraph it was more about<br>conquering personal fears.</p>\n<h3>Slides</h3>\n<p>Original slides were in polish. I translated them into English for blog readers.</p>\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/SlawomirRadzyminski/from-productivity-to-sabotage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"From productivity to sabotage\">From productivity to sabotage - tester in 2020</a></p>\n"
