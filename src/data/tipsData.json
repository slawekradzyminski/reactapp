    "content": "<p>In our world, there are many things that can be considered fragile. Imagine, for example, a glass or a balloon. These\nobjects are destroyed by low-probability events. To visualize this, imagine a normal distribution. A glass functions\nnormally when we use it in a standard way (which means we are at the center of the &quot;bell&quot;), but there are quite a few\nevents in the tail (fat tails) that cause the glass to break.</p>\n<p>When thinking about the opposite of fragility, durability comes to mind first. To destroy a durable thing (e.g., a\nwall), we have to make a significant effort. The bell curve of normal distribution for durable things is very large, and\nthe entire tail is characterized by a very low probability.</p>\n<p>Antifragility, in the definition of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, goes a step further. Antifragility is a feature of things\nthat makes them stronger under the influence of low-probability events. An antifragile glass, for example, would gain\nvalue from an accidental fall (e.g., by filling up with beer).\nIn practice, achieving antifragility is usually very difficult, but the attempt itself brings many benefits. I would\nlike to encourage you to think about how to become an antifragile engineer.</p>\n<p>The number one rule of the famous investor, Warren Buffett, is: &quot;Never lose money.&quot; This can be easily translated to our\nsituation: &quot;Try to ensure your professional situation never worsens.&quot; In practice, this means taking great care of\nso-called &quot;employability,&quot; i.e., continuously improving your skills that are in demand in the job market. As Seniors+,\nwe have a significant influence on technology choices in the company. For experiments (e.g., with the Rust language), I\nrecommend using insignificant tools/projects. If you need to write a mock, it&#39;s best to base it on a proven stack (e.g.,\nSpring Boot in Java). When choosing testing tools, it&#39;s best to use something proven in the industry, like Playwright,\nCypress, Selenium, k6, Locust, Gatling, Rest Assured, Requests, etc. I want to point out that the choice I recommend\nbrings benefits not only to you but also to the company. It&#39;s easy to recruit specialists for solutions written in the\nstandard stack.</p>\n<p>As a Senior+, you will often be judged not by what you do, but by what others do based on your advice. In the case of\nthe so-called &quot;Individual Contributor&quot; (IC) path, there&#39;s no escaping a certain dose of leadership. Knowing this, it&#39;s\nbest to position yourself in a hybrid, leadership/technical role. In my case, I combine the duties of a Team Leader of a\nsmall team of testers with technical work.</p>\n<p>A high degree of antifragility is also guaranteed by all kinds of activities outside the organization. Conferences,\ntraining, Friday tips for Seniors, YouTube. Creating content has never been easier. I encourage you to think of yourself\nas a content producer, not just a consumer. If you&#39;re looking for training for yourself, first ask yourself: shouldn&#39;t I\nbe the one leading it?</p>\n<p>Books:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Ufyalq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Antifragile</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Yv4zXC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Black Swan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YtKe4X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fooled by Randomness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zVrli1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Skin in the Game</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4dNnwJu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Full Incerto - all Taleb books in one</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ha0fnX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Software Engineer&#39;s Guidebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "content": "<p>In our testing bubble, much is said about a deep business understanding of the tested application/functionality. We have\ncoined many terms, more or less useful, which we can ask about in an interview (Three Amigos in Agile, BDD). Here, I&#39;m\ndeliberately omitting the effectiveness of these practices. Every Senior+ should organize this in a way that works for\nthem. It&#39;s unquestionable that building such understanding has been, is, and will be important. Incidentally, this is\nstill an area where people have a huge advantage over generative AI.</p>\n<p>For some reason, another aspect that I consider equally important hasn&#39;t yet penetrated our bubble - a deep TECHNICAL\nunderstanding of the tested application. What communicates with what? Where are the boundaries of our system? Where do\nwe integrate with other systems maintained by teams in our company? Where do we have integration with systems maintained\nby other companies (3rd-party dependency)? How to test integration within our system, between systems in the company,\nand between our system and external service providers? What protocol is used for communication? What are WebSockets? How\ndo frontend and backend know we are logged in? How to circumvent this? Can we move tests to a lower level?</p>\n<p>Building a deep technical understanding is very important in the era of microservices and ubiquitous asynchronous\ncommunication. How to test an event-based architecture? Why do architects decide to introduce queues/topics instead of\nrelying on a synchronous HTTP interface? How does this affect our functional and non-functional tests?</p>\n<p>Building a deep technical understanding is an excellent way to maximize the benefits we can derive from our work. By\norganizing this in our heads, we not only become better testers of the current system but also build transferable\nknowledge that becomes our personal capital.

    "content": "<p>In ancient battles, generals would often stand on the highest hill to get a clear view of the entire battlefield. This wide perspective allowed them to make strategic decisions based on the big picture, rather than getting caught up in the details of each individual fight.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in today&#39;s professional world, if you&#39;re aiming for a promotion or a leadership role, you need to look beyond just your team and projects. It’s important to understand how your work fits into the larger goals of the organization.</p>\n<p>Engineers often struggle with this shift. They may be excellent at what they do but can find it difficult to broaden their focus and show leadership across the organization.</p>\n<p>At a certain point, doing your job well isn&#39;t enough. You need to expand your thinking. Start by taking on responsibilities beyond your current role. For example, tackle unresolved issues, or take the initiative to implement performance or security tests that others may have missed.</p>\n<p>This can be intimidating because it takes you from being an expert in one area to being a beginner in another. However, as the concept of a &quot;beginner’s mind&quot; teaches us, being open to learning new things and leaving your ego at the door is essential for growth. Are you ready to embrace that mindset?</p>\n<p>Here are some practical tips to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Read Widely: Don’t limit yourself to books and content only in your field. Broaden your perspective by reading about various topics—whether it’s business, social sciences, security, programming, or even leadership from a historical lens. If you only consume content from your specific area, you risk narrowing your worldview.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Avoid Tactical Hell: Constantly putting out fires and reacting to immediate issues without a strategic plan can burn you out. If you find yourself stuck in this cycle, take a step back. Do you feel like others are leading your life? Sometimes it helps to take a break, do something different, like a sport or hobby, to clear your mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Seek Strategic Heaven: Look for areas within your influence where you can make an impact. If tackling a massive project, like stabilizing a huge test suite, seems overwhelming redefine the problem. Perhaps whe whole test suite should be dumped in favour of lower level tests? Are you willing to stop Sisyphus work?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Challenge Yourself Beyond Your Comfort Zone: You don’t need to become an expert in every field, but try doing something that pushes your thinking. This is especially relevant for those in specialized roles like testing or DevOps who are looking to take on more responsibility. If you went back to your old role, would you approach it the same way?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Understand the Business: Do you really know how your company makes money? What projects are vital to the company’s success? Figure out if those projects need more formal testing strategies, or if some areas have less customer impact and can be handled more flexibly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Delegate: Free yourself from the day-to-day execution. If you&#39;re caught up in routine tasks, you won’t have the time or energy to think strategically or plan for the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Broaden Your View: Don’t just surround yourself with people who think like you. Seek out diverse opinions, bring in people with different perspectives, and invite them into discussions. Challenging your assumptions will expand your understanding.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Book recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4eMgQN5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Napoleon: A Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4eSIpEC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Don&#39;t Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NuRuYb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Yys6qQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Small Unit Leadership: A Commonsense Approach</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Yv0a70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "title": "Keep Coding",
    "content": "<p>One of the aspects of working as a Staff Engineer that divides authors the most is dedicating one’s own work time to programming. Some encourage doing this as often as possible, while others recommend focusing on strategic work, planning, and setting development directions for the organization. In theory, it is true that one coding individual can hardly make a huge impact on the organization, but in practice, our fellow engineer colleagues are reluctant to follow someone detached from daily engineering work. There is even an archetype described in literature known as the &quot;Ivory Tower Architect,&quot; whose sole task is to devise idealized solutions for a perfect world that exists only in their mind.</p>\n<p>My opinion on this matter is very straightforward: regardless of their role, a Senior should consistently and regularly develop and nurture their programming skills. This also applies to software testers, who often unjustifiably look for excuses by saying that their specialization lies in testing. This approach practically closes the path to further promotion for the tester, and the glass ceiling above their head is of their own making.</p>\n<p>To develop in programming, it is worthwhile to set two paths for oneself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first should involve our favorite language (e.g., Java). It is useful here to look at a sample job offer for a Java programmer and see what is required. We will probably encounter knowledge of one of the leading frameworks (Spring) and understanding of typically backend mechanisms, such as rate limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second should focus on learning another language. Here, I recommend JavaScript or Python because of the multitude of things that can be relatively easily created only in these languages. For instance, most things related to AI are in Python (Langchain), and creating my website awesome-testing.com required knowledge of React and JS.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Programming is also a creative activity. We can create things from scratch, giving us a unique opportunity to make things useful for us or the project. Ideas for learning programming in a tester&#39;s job:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A service mocking dependencies of 3rd party or other teams’ services</li>\n<li>A tool for creating test data</li>\n<li>A tool for cleaning up the test environment</li>\n<li>A tool for collecting and presenting results of automated tests</li>\n<li>Integration with Jira/TestRail API and automatic reporting</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep calm &amp; keep coding :)</p>\n<p>Bibliography:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4hdlxkz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mastery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/48cBl34\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Clean Code</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4hdUNRa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tidy First</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Y9fipn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Professional Javascript for Web Developers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BSAQiz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Atomic Habits</a></li>\n</ul>\n"
